# this.sky - a simple weather app

## Project Description

[this.sky](https://catehardy.github.io/this.sky/) is an elegantly simple weather app. It displays the current weather in any chosen location around the world, using data fetched from the OpenWeather API.

It’s currently a WIP and when finished will feature a dynamically changing background, to represent the current weather forecast.

As a self-taught developer, I’ve previously followed tutorials to build projects. This is my first solo project, built from my imagination and much Googling!
